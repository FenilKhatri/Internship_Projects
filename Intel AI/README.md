## 1. Order_To_Delivery
  Timelytics is an ensemble model that utilizes three powerful machine learning algorithms - XGBoost, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) - to forecast Order to Delivery (OTD) times accurately. By combining the strengths of these three algorithms, Timelytics provides a robust and reliable prediction of OTD times, helping businesses to optimize their supply chain operations. With Timelytics, companies can identify potential bottlenecks and delays in their supply chain and take proactive measures to address them, reducing lead times and improving delivery times. The model utilizes historical data on order processing times, production lead times, shipping times, and other relevant variables to generate accurate forecasts of OTD times. These forecasts can be used to optimize inventory management, improve customer service, and increase overall efficiency in the supply chain.

## 2. Teachable_Machine
  A Streamlit web application for real-time detection of manufacturing defects in cast metal impellers. This project uses a deep learning model trained using Teachable Machine and deployed via Streamlit to classify images as 'Normal' or 'Anomaly'.
